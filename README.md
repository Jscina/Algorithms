# Time Complexity

The big O Complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3) because each loop must run n times.
This is shown by the op_count which rises at a rate of n^3 as the input size increases.
1x1: 2
10X10: 1100
100X100: 1010000

If you take the cube root of the op_count you get roughly n which is the input size.
